            <h3>What we have to offer</3>
            <p>When coming to this page, you will be able to browse through archives of trainer-approved techniques to help you avoid injury, stretches both before and after your workouts, diet plans that have been used in the past and shown promising results, and most importantly workout plans both free and some with a charge if you are willing to pay a fee, both of which have been looked at with personal trainers and have helped others in the past increase their total lift weights. With all this data that has been collected, you have the ability to fine-tune your programs and diet plan to fit your daily routine and lifestyle.</p>
            <p>After reading this, you are probably thinking to yourself that this is too good to be true, well itâ€™s not. We want to give knowledge and understanding to all who want to progress with training. We offer both free access to Build a Bar and a paid membership for those looking to go the extra mile with their progress. The paid membership not only gives you the ability to have access to the content that we have found on the web but our team will customize it for you. From giving you advice on programs that will best fit your needs and timeframe to helping you find ways to get your nutrition on track to better perform at the gym as well as in competitions. Payments can be made for different amounts of time, with the following packages: one week, one month, three months, six months, and one year. Note that the longer you are subscribed, the better the deal is for you.</p>
