We believe that powerlifting is a sport that anyone can try, with this website you can use it to lose weight, increase totals, or simply find a new hobby to help take your mind off of the daily stresses of our lives


        The main reason why this website was created was because let's all face it, the internet is full of information, some of it is worth looking at that will help you reach your goal, and some of it that is simply false and is going to lead you down a trail of doing useless exercises that help with nothing or is all-out dangerous to do.  Luckily here at Build A Bar, we have teams that analyze everything to do with powerlifting.  From their analyzations they check if it safe and worthwhile if it is Great, they bring it onto the site so it can be found and used by newcomers to the powerlifting world who are in need of guidance.  If it is not safe or worthwhile, they simply don’t add it on to the site
